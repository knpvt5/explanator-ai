# Use of the Models and their Functionalities

The code in the image demonstrates tools and workflows for using machine learning models, managing datasets, and fine-tuning local models. Below are the potential real-life use cases:

---

## Chatbots

- **Customer Support**: These models can power chatbots to handle customer inquiries in industries like e-commerce, healthcare, and banking.
- **Virtual Assistants**: Can be integrated into applications like voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa) for natural language interaction.
- **Education and Training**: Used to create interactive learning tools that answer questions and provide explanations.

---

## Docs Analyzer

- **Document Processing**: Extracts data and insights from documents like PDFs, CSVs, or web pages, making it useful for legal, financial, and research-based industries.
- **Content Summarization**: Automates the summarization of large documents, reducing manual effort.
- **Data Extraction**: Can be used in applications that need to extract structured information (e.g., invoices, contracts).
